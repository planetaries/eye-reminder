# eye-reminder

a chrome extension that displays a popup every 20 minutes to remind you to rest your eyes (this can be toggled on or off if it gets too annoying or you're about to share your screen over a video call ☺)

inspired by the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, take a break to look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds
